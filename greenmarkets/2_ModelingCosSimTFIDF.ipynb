       " \"Smoked Whole Chicken chicken salt suggar granulated brown rosemary pepper corns clove sage thyme smokedpaprika garlic powder kosher salt pepper rosemary butter apple juice Fill a 3 to 4 qt. sauce pan about 2/3 full with water and turn on the burner to medium heat.  Add the salt, pepper and the rosemary for the brine.  Crack the pepper and cloves and crush up the thyme and sage and add to the pan.  Bring this mixture up to a simmer.  Let it simmer for a few minutes to disolve the salt and suggar and to get the aeromatics all blended in.  In a large pan or bucket (large enough to hold the chicken(s), add the brine, chickens and enough cold warter to cover.  Set the container in the fridge and let it brine for at least 4 hours.  I usually let mine stay in the brine over night.  After you have let the birds brine as long as you wanted them to, remove from the brine and rinse off the brine.  At this point you can do one of two things.  You can start putting all the spices on the bird or you can remove the backbone first.  By removing the backbone you allow the chicken to lay flat on the grill and get a more even cooking.  Either way this will still be the best most juicy chicken you have ever had.  Adding the spices and herbs:  Add some salt and pepper to the underside of the chicken and then turn over with the brest side up.  With your fingers seperate the skin from the breast and thighs, being careful not to rip the skin.  Get as much of the spices under the skin as possible rubbing in onto the meat.  Divide the butter up and put it under the skin. Then add the rosemary sprigs under. You can add a little oil to the outside and sprinkle with salt pepper and paprika if you wish.  I normally do.  Before putting the bird on the smoker you need to get it ready.  Get your coals going and add what ever type of hardwood you like.  I don't think there is any wrong wood.  I have used hickory, oak, apple, pecan, maple and misquite.  All the chickens have come out delicious.  You will need to control your fire so it matains a temperature between 200? and 225? throughout the cooking process.  It should take about 4 hours to cook a four pound chicken to about 170? in the thickest part of the breast. Throughout the cooking process I like to spray apple juice on the skin to keep it moist.\",\n",

I am in the middle of preparing this very recipe  and so far it smells heavenly. I hope that yall will like it too.    Heat the lard or oil in a small or medium size skillet over medium-high  heat until almost smoking. Add the achiote and saute, shaking the pan  constantly, for 5 minutes. Place the achiote in a heatproof bowl and cover  with the orange juice. Let soak overnight in the refrigerator or at least 3  to 4 hours at room temperature. All the liquid should be absorbed and the  seeds should be somewhat softened.    Heat a small, heavy skillet or griddle over high heat until a drop of water  sizzles on contact. Add the cumin seeds and toast, shaking the pan  frequently, until fragrant. Set the toasted seeds aside. Toast the  peppercorns in the same manner and set aside. Toast the oregano and set  aside. Work carefully while toasting the spices so that they do not scorch;  remove them from the pan as soon as their fragrance is released, 1 to 2  minutes. In the same skillet, roast the garlic cloves over high heat,  turning several times, until dark on all sides and somewhat softened, 5 to  10 minutes. Peel the garlic and set aside with the spices.    Place the soaked achiote, salt and spices in a blender or food processor  fitted with the steel blade. Grind thoroughly with a pulse motion, adding  more water or orange juice, if necessary. Work in batches, if necessary.  The mixture should be a smooth paste. Refrigerate until ready to use.    Can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator several weeks, or  indefinitely in small containers in the freezer.    YIELD: about 3 cups.

Cut 2 pounds of uncooked chicken breast meat into chunks, and set aside. Pour 1 cup flour into a zip-lock bag, and set aside. Now, take about half of the herb seasoning mixture, and add it to your uncooked chicken chunks, and work it in with your hands. This will give a medium amount of spiciness to the chicken. Add more of the herb seasoning, if you like a spicier flavor. (You may cover the chicken with plastic wrap, and let it sit in the refrigerator to absorb the herb flavors for about 4 hours, if you choose, but that is not necessary.) When you are ready to fry your herb-seasoned chicken chunks, heat about ? cup of peanut oil in a skillet, until a sprinkling of flour sizzles. Then, place a handful of seasoned chicken chunks in the zip lock bag, shake the bag until the chicken chunks are thoroughly coated, shake off any excess flour, and place them individually into the hot oil. Continue until you have a single layer of chicken chunks in the skillet. Reduce the heat, and tend to the chicken closely, as it will cook quickly! When each piece is brown on the bottom side, turn it over to brown on the top side. When both sides are brown, the chicken is most likely done. You may test for doneness by cutting into the largest piece, and it should be white all the way through?no pink! Remove the chicken chunks to a plate that is covered with paper toweling for draining any excess oil. Repeat the process to make a second skillet of Popcorn Chicken. (You may have to remove any leftover crumbs from the skillet, and replenish the peanut oil, by adding another ? cup.) When all of the chicken has been fried and drained, remove it to a nice serving platter. This is great for kids?big kids, too!!! Note: I am not making any claim that this is the official secret recipe of Kentucky Fried Chicken, only that it is *my* version of Kentucky Fried Popcorn Chicken?which I think you will find to be much healthier, having more meat and less coating, and therefore having less salt and fat!

If you roast the garlic, it will have a  \"nutty\" flavor.    In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and add the shallots. When light  golden brown, add the chicken stock and peeled garlic. Bring to a boil and  add the milk and the diluted cornstarch. Put mixture in a blender and blend  thoroughly until very smooth. Strain through a fine sieve.    Cook the pasta according to package directions. In the meantime, in a saute  pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and cook the baby shrimp on both sides.  Add the creamy garlic mixture. Season with salt, pepper and cilantro.    Add the (optional) parmesan cheese, mix well. Add the penne and toss to  coat well. Serve immediately.    Roasting Method: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Do not remove the papery outer  skin from the garlic. With a very sharp knife, cut the garlic head in half  sideways. Set the garlic halves, cut side up, on a piece of aluminum foil,  then drizzle each half with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Arrange sprigs of  rosemary on each half and sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper. Close  the aluminum foil and roast for about 45 minutes, or until tender and  buttery.    Poaching Method: Separate the cloves of the head of garlic, but do not peel  them. Bring 2 small saucepans of water to boil, then put the garlic in one  of them. Poach for 7 minutes, then drain and return the garlic to the other  pot of boiling water. Let cook 7 minutes, then drain and return garlic to  the first pot, once again filled with boiling water, for final blanching.  This will eliminate any bitterness. Cool the garlic briefly, then slip the  cloves out of their skins.    This recipe may look complicated, but really, it is quite easy to prepare.  The key to its success is to either blanch or roast the garlic. Whichever  method you select, you are going to love it. If you do not have baby  shrimp, try to make it with chicken tenderloin ... it is also an incredible  dish.

Place  scallops on the grid or for best results use a greased vegetable & fish  grill basket. The baskets are available at most department stores outdoor  leisure departments. Grill for 3 minutes, baste with marinade and turn,  grill 2-3 minutes, baste again with marinade until done. Scallops cook very  quickly, it should take no more than 6 minutes of cooking time, total.    NOTES : For the finishing sauce bring remaining marinade to a boil on the  stovetop for approximately 5-6 minutes. Serve on the side at the table.    Recipe by: The BarBeQue Man      ',\n",

Dip chicken into yogurt mixture (chicken should be coated with thick layer of yogurt) and arrange on wire rack set in foil-lined rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan. Discard excess yogurt mixture. Broil chicken until thickest parts register 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer and exterior is lightly charred in spots, 10 to 18 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking.

Then place the potatoes in a large  bowl and, using an electric hand whisk on a slow speed, start to break the  potatoes up, then increase the speed and gradually whisk until smooth and  fluffy. Now let them cool.    3 Add the sifted flour to the potatoes, along with half the beaten egg,  season lightly and, using a fork, bring the mixture together.    4 Using your hands, knead the mixture lightly to a soft dough - you may  need to add a tsp or so more of the egg if it is a little dry. Now transfer  the mixture to a slightly floured surface, flour your hands and divide it  into quarters. Now roll each quarter into a sausage shape approximately  1\"/2.5cm in diameter, then cut it, on the diagonal, into 1\"/2.5cm pieces,  placing them on a tray or plate as they are cut. Cover with clingfilm and  chill for at least       30    mins, longer wont matter.    5 Using a fork with the prongs facing upwards, press the fork down on to  one side of each gnocchi so that it leaves a row of ridges on each one. At  the same time, ease them into crescent shapes. The ridges are there to  absorb the sauce. Cover and chill the gnocchi again until you are ready to  cook them.    6 To cook the gnocchi: Firstly bring a large, shallow pan of approximately  6 pints/3.5 litres of water to a simmer and put the serving dish in a low  oven to warm through.    7 Then drop the gnocchi into the water and cook for about 3 minutes; they  will start to float to the surface after about 2 minutes, but they need 3  altogether. When they are ready, remove the gnocchi with a draining spoon  and transfer them to a warm serving dish.    8 To serve, melt the butter with the garlic over a gentle heat until the  garlic turns nut brown in colour - about 1 minute.    9 Next add the sage leaves and allow the butter to froth while the sage  leaves turn crisp - about 30 seconds - then spoon the butter mixture over  the warm gnocchi.

Saute slowly until  onions are just tender.  Add the ground beef and brown. Cook onions and  ground beef about 7 minutes.  Drain off the fat. Return to medium heat.  Separately mix the broccoli cheese soup and milk. Stir until creamy in  texture. At this point test for taste.  I usually add table grind black  pepper and salt (less that 1/2 teaspoon). When the ground beef is ready,  add the rice and broccoli, and soup mixture, tossing carefully. Put the  mixture in to a 9 x 9, or 9 x 13 casserole dish. Sometimes I top this with  seasoned bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Bake about 35 minutes.    Recipe By     :    Posted to Master Cook Recipes List, Digest #90',\n",

Make a well in center of  potatoes and add yolk to well. Sprinkle one-third of the flour over  potatoes and combine potatoes, yolk and flour, mixing with your hands. Add  another third of flour, kneading, then remaining flour, until a smooth,  slightly sticky dough is formed. Divide dough in 4 pieces and roll each  into a 15-inch-long rope, about 3/4-inch in diameter. Using a floured  knife, cut each rope into 30 pieces. Dip tines of a dinner fork in flour  and gently roll dough several times back and forth to form decorative  ridges on one side. Make tomato sauce: In a saucepan sweat onion and garlic  in oil over medium heat until onions are golden and tender, 10 minutes. Add  tomatoes and juice; bring to a boil and cook 3 minutes. Add basil and  season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring a large pot of salted water to  a boil and drop in gnocchi. Cook until they rise to surface, about 2  minutes, and continue cooking 30 seconds more. Drain in a colander. In a  large skillet, melt butter, add gnocchi, pour tomato sauce over, and toss  to combine. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve immediately. This recipe  yields 4 servings.

I use enough to almost create a crust of the spices but you can use a little less.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown both sides of the chops in the hot pan, about a minute on each sides. After browning, add hot or warm water, about enough to go 2/3 of the way up the sides of the chops. Sprinkle a generous amount of rosemary and around 10 dashes of worcestershire sauce into the water and over the chops. Cover and turn heat down to a high simmer. Cook for about ten minutes (depending on thickness of chops), turn and cook another ten minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemove chops to plates. Turn the pan back up to high and use a wooden spoon to stir the liquid in the pan. After a minute or a few (depending on the stove), the sauce will thicken. When it coats the spoon, pour the sauce over the tops of the chops. If you are using a gas stove, use the chops themselves to stir the sauce around so they get coated as the sauce thickens.\",\n",

In this case, the seasonings--sage, Parmesan, garlic--underscore that choice.

As an added boon, pinot noir has a supple, silky texture--just the ticket for a savory bird. Be forewarned: Great pinot noirs are expensive, but this is the time of year to splurge.

Instead, add this to your sauce - just make sure your bring your sauce to a simmer before serving.  Too delicious to simply discard. The flavor and texture of the yogurt work perfectly with the sauce.  If it''s too sour, simply add more cream/milk, or honey to balance the flavor.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) If you don''t have time to marinade the chicken as directed, no problem! Simply combine all of the meat ingredients in a mixing bowl from Step 1 and Step 2 above.  Place the chicken pieces into the bowl, and cover chicken with marinade well.  Let this sit for 5 minutes, while you prepare the sauce as shown above.   Place marinade and chicken into a frying pan and simmer on high heat until chicken is near done.  Simply pour contents of chicken and marinade in frying pan into your main sauce pan.  Season to taste.  Enjoy!\",\n",

Add the white wine and continue cooking on high and stirring until the wine is reduced.  Add the cream and lemon juice, reducing heat to medium, until slightly reduced (about 1-2 minutes).  Do not let the cream boil.  Add the crawfish tails and shrimp and continue to stir until they are warmed through (about 2 minutes).  Note that I use pre cooked shrimp to save time here.  Add the onions and parsley and cook for one minute more.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNow add the contents of the skillet to the pot with the pasta in it and give it a good toss.  Move the pot to the active burner and reduce the heat to low.  The pasta should have stayed warm during the process, but continue to toss and coat for about one minute more.  This brings everything up to temperature and works very well.    \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, take the contents of the pot and transfer to a serving dish.

Add 1 cup of the marinade  liquid plus some of the vegetables and bay leaves. Cover tightly and simmer  on surface heat or in a preheated 350oF oven for 3 to 4 hours until the  meat is fork tender.  If needed, add more marinade during the cooking time  to keep at least 1/2 inch liquid in the Dutch oven. Remove the meat and  keep warm until ready to slice. Into a large measuring cup, strain the  drippings.  Add several ice cubes and let stand for a few minutes until the  fat separates out. Remove the fat, then make the gravy.

Mix the rice wine/ sherry and 1 tablespoon soy sauce  together, and add to the pork.  With your fingers rub the mixture into  meat.  Still using your fingers, roll the cubes in about 1/2 cup cornstarch  until thoroughly dredged but not too thickly covered.  (The fineness of the  end result of this recipe depends on the meats being crisp -- never  soggy.)\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cut the carrot on the diagonal into 1/4-inch slices. Cut the green  pepper in half; remove seeds and cut into 1-inch squares. Cut the pineapple  slices into 1/2-inch wedges.  Wash the Chinese mushrooms and soak in warm  water for 30 minutes.  Drain, remove stems. Cut into 1/2-inch strips.  Smash, peel, and mince garlic.  Combine garlic, carrots, green pepper,  pineapple, and mushrooms.  \\r\\n\\r\\n  Combine vinegar, 1/2 cup water, black pepper, 1  tablespoon soy sauce, salt, sugar, and chili pepper. In a cup, mix 1  tablespoon cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water.   \\r\\n\\r\\n  COOKING:    Heat oil in deep fry pan to 375-degrees.  Cook pork cubes a few at a time  until very light brown, about 5 minutes.  Stir with a chopstick  occasionally so that the cubes do not touch each other.  Drain on paper  towels, and keep hot in low oven (200-degrees).  \\r\\n\\r\\n  Repeat this process,  cooking pork in hot oil until cubes float and are golden brown -- 2 to 3  minutes.  (This double cooking insures that the meat will be crisp.) \\r\\n\\r\\n  Heat  the water-vinegar mixture in small saucepan.  In a medium-sized skillet or  wok, heat 2 tablespoons of oil at high heat. \\r\\n\\r\\n   Add vegetable-pineapple  mixture and stir-fry for 4 minutes.  Add the hot water-vinegar mixture to  the vegetables and stir well.  Add the cornstarch mixture, and cook and  stir until thickened, about 1 minute.

       " \"Lemon-thyme Kitchen Grilled Boneless Pork Chops porkchops lemon juice thyme meat tenderizer freshly pepper extra virgin olive oil Place the two boenless pork chops in a small bowl. Sprinkle lemon juice geneously on the top, bottom, and between the two chops. Place a spring of thyme (or dried thyme) on the top and bottom and between the chops. Rub the thyme to infuse some of the flavor into the pork chops. If you have time, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the pork chops marinate for 10 to 12 hours, occasionally rubbing the thyme into the chops. If you don't have time, you may skip the actual marinating, and you will still get a lot of lemon and thyme flavor. When you are ready to grill the pork chops, start heating your electric kitchen grill, putting the drip cup in place. Remove any thyme springs and pat the pork chops dry with a paper towel. Now, lightly sprinkle the tops and bottoms of the two pork chops with meat tenderizer. (This will serve as salt, also.) Next, grind some fresh black peppercorns over the top and bottom of each pork chop. Finally, (with your fingers) spread extra virgin olive oil over the top and the bottom of each pork chop. Place the pork chops on your heated kitchen grill, and close the grill. Open the grill after a few minutes to check on the pork chops, and rearrange, if needed. You may turn them, if you like. Close the grill, and let them continue to cook until completely done. For 1/2-inch pork chops, this won't take long--about 8 to 10 minutes total cooking time. The pork chops are done when they are cut with a knife and the meat is white. Be sure to cook pork *completely*! These pork chops are very elegant for serving with a fancy meal for two, and the lemon and thyme give a subtle, but tangy flavor that is just the best!!!\",\n",
